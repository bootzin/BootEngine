# Contributing to Boot Engine
First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!
These are some guidelines for contributing, but they're not rules, so please use your best judgement

## Documentation/Testing
- Documentation and testing will always be welcomed! We are always in need of people willing to help us in this regard!

## Bug report
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/bootzin/BootEngine/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/bootzin/BootEngine/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Pull Requests
- If you've written a fix to a bug or added a new functionality, feel free to open a new pull request with it!
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
- Please try to follow the coding style of the rest of the project. Following a pattern is important for code maintenance. If you feel like the style used is not good, feel free to open an Issue to discuss it
- Generally speaking, PRs that make purely "cosmetic" changes will not be accepted, but feel free to propose something if think it's relevant.
- Try to document/test your code, when applicable
- Finally, use good and meaningful commit messages
